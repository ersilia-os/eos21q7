    "Description": "This model has been trained on a publicly available collection of 5 datasets manually curated for drug-induced-liver-injury (DILI). DILI outcome has been binarised, and ECFP descriptors, together with physicochemical properties have been used to train a random forest classifier which achieves AUROC > 0.9",
