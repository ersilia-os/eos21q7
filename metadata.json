    "Title": "interpretable prediction of drug-induced liver injury through permutation feature importance and attention mechanism",
    "Description": "This study focused on interpreting the model prediction to analyze which features could potentially cause DILI and indicated that the model not only captured the previously known properties to be related to DILI but also proposed a new DILI potential substructural of physicochemical properties.",
    "Mode": "Retrained",
    "Task": ["Classification"],
    "Input": ["Compound"],
    "Input Shape": "Single",
    "Output": ["Probability"],
    "Output Type": ["Float"],
    "Output Shape": "Single",
    "Interpretation": "The model predicts the probability of Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI) based on compound features, providing a probability score ranging from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating greater risk",
